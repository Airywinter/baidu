                                    as it is filtered by O2 when it detect traffic on public p2p sharing in my situation
                                    all my internet speed slows to 512Kbit/s. I never had 400KB/s on when downloading
                                    from p2p public servers like torrent emule etc. I downoad with 500KB/s from private
                                    trakers instead. So conlcusion O2 block trafic on p2p connections. I have made hundreds
                                    of test in Italy and Sweden and Romania with the same file to doanload with the same
                                    setting and same antivirus and just needed to open ports in firewall and forward
                                    same ports and the speed was at full capacity in 1 minute. here in 9 month never
